# stratos-buildpack
Custom buildpack for the stratos-ui for Cloud Foundry.

Stratos UI (https://github.com/SUSE/stratos-ui) consists of a JavaScript front-end and a Go back-end. In order to build the UI when pushing to Cloud Foundry, this custom buildpack is used to build both the front-end and the back-end.
